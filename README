SDP-Filter - a lightweight SDP filter by Moritz Blanke

Description:
	SDP-Filter provies an easy way to filter the SDP packets on ANY interface

Dependencies:
	libnetfilter-queue
	linux-kernel >= 2.6.14
Usage:
	SDP-Filter needs to be fed the packets via the NFQUEUE of iptables, for example:

		iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -p udp --dport 9875 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 42

	Kernel module nfnetlink_queue needs to be loaded.
	Since UDP:9875 is the standard port for SDP, any packets which may be fed into the queue
	(e.g. through misconfiguration of iptables) and are NOT SDP packets on UDP:9875 are
	being forwarded as further specified by iptables.

Configuration:
	SDP-Filter provides harcoded configuration through the file config.h
		
		1] #define QUEUE 42
		2] #define BLACKLIST true
		3] #define RULESC 2
		4] #define RULES\
		5]	{<verdict>,<attribute>,<filter>,<string>}, \
		6]	{<verdict>,<attribute>,<filter>,<string>}, \
		7]

	1] QUEUE defines the netfilter-queue, as specified above by iptables
	2] BLACKLIST defines the default behaviour of SDP-Filter:
		true: blacklist - all packets, except for those denied by the rules are forwarded 
		false: whitelist - all packets, except for those allowed by the rules are dropped
	3] RULESC defines the number of rules specified in 4-6]...
	4-6] RULES defines the rules by which SDL-Filter filters
		verdict: ALLOW||DISALLOW specifies which action has to be taken if a rule matches
		attribute: "string" specifies the attribute which is to be tested. e.g. "a=x-plgroup",
			"s=" or "m=video". See RFC4566 (or use Wireshark) for a list of viable attributes
		filter: IS||BEGINS_WITH||ENDS_WITH||CONTAINS string operator which is used to compare
			string to the value of the attribute.
		string: "string" specifies the value which is compared by above operators against
			the specified attribute
	7] The C-Preprocessor dictates: if the last rule 6] ends with \ an empty line has to follow
	
Example:
	{ALLOW,"s=",BEGINS_WITH,"[Radio] "}, \
